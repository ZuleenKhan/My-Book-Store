# My-Book-Store
A website built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This only pertains to the Frontend. To make the website responsive, numerous further changes must be made. The idea is to Bring Like-Minded People Together On A Single Platform Where They Can Talk About Their Reading Preferences And Provide Book Suggestions Based On Their Own Reading Experiences.
